## Overview

## Dev

- `npm run dev` for hot reloading with test data

## Deployment

- `npm run build` - builds a serverless frontend app that can be deployed the same way any SPA can be

## TODOs
- Update Open Api Spec
- CSS simplification
- Docs 2nd parse


## For later
- Negative Case handling (Use null object pattern in data providers to avoid)
- OIDC support. set JWT requirements for types and actions (do security in a reverse proxy of some sort)
